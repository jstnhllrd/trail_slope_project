# Trail Slope Project

The goal of this project is to develop tools for creating maps that illustrate the slope of terrain as a feature of hiking trails. The trail_slope.py script was developed in QGIS and accepts a line shapefile as input along with a digital elevation model.
The image below is an example map illustrating the percent slope along trails in Valley Falls State Park, WV.
